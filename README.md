# stormhacks

this repo is for our project at Storm Hacks 2025. Group members include: ahmad, adrian, rafee, annie

# How to run the program:

1. Have docker Installed
2. Clone the repo
3. Type "docker compose up --build" without the quotations in the terminal
4. To run, either go to to the docker app, select the container, and click the front end local host or you can just visit http://localhost:3000 or (whatever port you set your frontend to be on) on your web browser


### Remember to close the container after using, as it uses up some cpu space, and if you're running other projects it is occupying the same port.
